To debug using the demos in this directory, create a soft link from
"api" in this directory to the directory containing the exhibit api
you wish to test (for example, the "src" directory or, after you build
it, the "dist" directory of this repository).  You may also want to
force exhibit to use the unbundled version of the api, by passing
"exhibit-dev=true" as an argument in the url of the demo you are
visiting,
e.g. http://localhost/demos/presidents.html?exhibit-dev=true .
